# Alio

Depends on `libvlc 2.X` for building (but the release should be compiled with the libvlc).

## Controls

- `Ctrl-n` + `Ctrl-p` emacs style next line prev line navigating the album collection.
- `Ctrl-c` `Esc` and `q` for quitting.
- `Space` and `Enter` for playing an album.

## TODO:

There are some functions missing from the `libvlc` c-go bindings which I need to add:

- [ ] Prev and Next Song in list
- [ ] Get Song Position from Player

### UI

- [ ] Adjust the stretch of columns
- [ ] Update the progress bar
- [ ] Display song name in status bar
- [ ] Display keybindings on help
